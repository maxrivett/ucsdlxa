## Course Matching

A program in Java created by Max Rivett, High Sigma (2022), that takes a list of students and their major/courses, and creates files by course and major that contain the names and emails of the students in that course or major.

## Study Room Booking Bot

A program in the works that will book a study room at midnight two weeks in advance - when the slot first opens - every weekday.
